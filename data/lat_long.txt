A basic description of lat-long coordinates for our purposes:

-We will be using 5 decimals points of precision which will give us a expected
accuracy of 1.1 meters.

-Latitude will be the first value and Longitude will be the second value.
	ie: 39.73923, -104.99025

	+A negative sign for latitude would denote the southern hemisphere
	+A negative sign for the longitude would denote the western hemisphere

-As the value for Latitude increases the object will be moving north, if it is
decreasing the object will be moving south

-As the value for Longitude decreases the object will be moving east, if it is
decreasing the the object is moving west

I am thinking at this point the JSON data objects should be fairly easy, all
we need to have in it is lat, long coordinates and an ID for each lat long so
that our program can order the JSON objects appropriately and calculate vector.

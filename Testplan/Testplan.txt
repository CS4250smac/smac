Test Plan

Test Case 1: Ensure that data coming in from GPS box is valid. The data streams
are formatted as expected and able to be handled by our logic.  Accuracy is not
a concern for this test case.
	Steps:
		a. Send good data into the controller
		b. Send bad data into the controller
	Validation:
		a. Ensure controller passes on good data
		b. Ensure controller does

Test Case 2: Ensure that the controller is able to route valid data to the
proper state.
	Steps:
		a. Send data that we know should lead to the standby mode
		b. Send data that we know should lead to the takeoff / landing mode
		c. Send data that we know should lead to the in-flight mode
	Validation:
		a. Ensure data is sent to standby mode and no other modes, also ensure
		that machine stays in this state when no other data sent in
		b. Ensure data is sent to the takeoff / landing mode and no others, also
		ensure that machine stays in this state when no other data sent in
		c. Ensure data is sent to the in-flight mode and no others, also ensure
		that machine stays in this state when no other data sent in

Test Case 3: Ensure data from each state is processed by collision avoidance
logic appropriately.
	Steps:
		a. Send data that we know should trigger a warning from the standby mode
		b. Send data that we know should trigger a warning from the takeoff /
		landing mode
		c. Send data that we know should trigger a warning from the in-flight
		mode.
		d. Send data that we know should not trigger a warning from the standby
		mode
		e. Send data that we know should not trigger a warning from the takeoff
		/ landing mode
		f. Send data that we know should not trigger a warning from the
		in-flight mode
	Validation:
		a. Ensure an output signal fires the send messag logic
		b. Ensure an output signal fires the send messag logic
		c. Ensure an output signal fires the send messag logic
		d. Ensure an output signal does not fire the send messag logic
		e. Ensure an output signal does not fire the send messag logic
		f. Ensure an output signal does not fire the send messag logic

Test Case 4: Ensure that the sendMessage logic warns the crew or not as
designed and logs all messages it is passed.
	Steps:
		a. Send data that we know should trigger a warning from the standby mode
		b. Send data that we know should trigger a warning from the takeoff /
		landing mode
		c. Send data that we know should trigger a warning from the in-flight
		mode
	Validation:
		a. Ensure that the crew is not warned as this is standby mode, ensure
		message is logged
		b. Ensure that the crew is not warned as this is takeoff / landing mode,
		ensure message is logged
		c. Ensure that the crew is warned as this is in-flight mode, ensure the
		message is logged
